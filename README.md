## About The Project

The game initiates with the entrance of two players, each assigning a unique username for identification purposes. The gameplay proceeds with Player 1 making the initial move by selecting either a cooperative or defecting strategy. Subsequently, Player 2 responds based on the revealed move of Player 1, thereby completing the first round. The game progresses for an additional round, culminating in a total of two rounds. Following this, both players receive their respective reward values contingent upon their decisions during the game rounds.

Furthermore, the study delves into the application of a matrix illustrating Sub-perfect Nash equilibrium at each stage of the game. Players are then prompted to input specific behavioral trait factors, such as the Social Preference Factor, Temptation Payoff Factor, and Forgiveness Factor. Leveraging these inputs, an adjusted payoff matrix is constructed, integrating the original payoff matrix with the aforementioned factors. Subsequently, the Adjusted Payoff Matrix's Sub-perfect Nash equilibrium is elucidated based on the players' chosen strategies.

Conclusively, the study elucidates the rewards obtained by each player both before and after selecting their preference factors, highlighting the impact of these factors on the overall gameplay and subsequent outcomes.
